# Additionnal page configuration

# Additionnal configurations are loaded using its file name, minus the extension, as an anchor (https://<mydashboad>#<config>). 
# `config.yml` is still used as a base configuration, and all values here will overwrite it, so you don't have to re-defined everything


subtitle: "this is another dashboard page"

# This overwrites message config. Setting it to empty to remove message from this page and keep it only in the main one:
message:
  content: "<a href='https://open.spotify.com/user/0ebmfd1ib37v8yarqnep2gbgw'><img alt='Spotify' src='https://novatorem-larsgerber.vercel.app/api/spotify'/>"

# as we want to include a differente link here (so we can get back to home page), we need to replicate all links or they will be revome when overwriting the links field:
links:
  - name: "Home"
    icon: "fas fa-home"
    url: "#"
